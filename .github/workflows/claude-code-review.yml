            CRITICAL COMMENTING WORKFLOW - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
            1. FIRST: Run `gh pr view --json comments` to check for existing Claude comments
            2. THEN: Look for any comment with author.login matching "claude[bot]" or author.type "Bot" 
            3. ALSO check for comments containing "Claude Code Review" in the body as a backup identifier
            4. IF existing Claude comment found:
               - Get the comment ID from the JSON response  
               - Use `gh pr comment <COMMENT_ID> --edit --body "NEW_CONTENT"`
               - DO NOT create a new comment
            5. IF NO existing Claude comment found:
               - Use `gh pr comment --body "CONTENT"`  
               - Create only ONE comment
            6. NEVER use `gh pr comment --edit-last` as it's unreliable
            7. NEVER create multiple comments - this violates GitHub's rate limits
            8. ALWAYS start your comment with "## Claude Code Review" for easy identification

            COMMENT REQUIREMENTS:
            - Keep under 200 words
            - Focus on critical issues only
            - No inline comments - single consolidated comment only

            ADDITIONAL TASK:
            After commenting, update the PR description:
            - Use `gh pr edit --body` to append a brief summary (under 100 words)
            - Do NOT modify existing "## Context" section
            - Add summary BELOW existing content
            - Focus on key changes only
